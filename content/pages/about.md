Hey folks, I am Neel Modi. I am a sophomore year university student from India. I am pursuing B.Tech (Bachelor's) in Computer Science with specialization in AI and Machine Learning though I have no interest in neither AI nor Machine Learning.

My primary language for programming is Go. Talking about skills, I have experience working on projects which include the follwing technologies:

- Go
- Postgres
- Docker (I am currently learning the advance features)
- Github
- Github Actions
- Solidity (made a couple of dApps)
- React.js
- Svelte.js
- RESTful services
- gRPC
- Unit Testing
- Logging

My current goals are to get better at creating platforms with microservices architecture and to become a good distributed engineer. I have also keen interest in blockchain technologies like Ethereum and Polkadot to name a few.
